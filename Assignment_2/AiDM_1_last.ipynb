    "The [Netflix challenge](https://www.netflixprize.com/) was an open competition held by Netflix, an online movie rental platform. The competition was started in order to find the best collabrative filtering algorithm. This algorithm asked to predict the ratings of a user for a specific movie based on previous ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show the most basic - and most time consuming - approach to calculate the similarities between all the users in the dataset. In this dataset two users can be defined similar if they have watched a similar set of movies. The similarities are calculated using the Jaccard similarity. All user pairs with a Jaccard similarity above a certain threshold are defined as similar.\n",

    "## The dataset - Netflix Challenge\n",
    "Netflix, for the Netflix challenge, provided a dataset with 100.480.507 ratings given by 480.189 users to 17.770 movies. \n",
    "In this notebook we use an extract of the Netflix dataset that contains:\n",
    "-  about 65.225.506 combinations of a user and movie\n",
    "-  103703 users that rated a total of 17.770 different movies;\n",
    "-  Each user rated between 300 and 3000 movies\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw dataset consists in a list of 65.000.000 records, each record consists of two integers: *user_id* and *movie_id*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The brute force approach\n",
    "\n",
    "If two users have watched similar movies, it is more likely that they will both like the same movies in the future. If $user_1$ liked a movie, it is straightforward to think that $user_2$ - who has the same taste in movies - will like that movie too. Based on this idea it is useful to find the similarity between each user pair, to find users who are similar. \n",
    "The easiest way to find if two users are similar is to compare them; Basically, check if $user_1$ watched what $user_2$ watched. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process seems simple, but with big datasets it is not doable in terms of time. In this work we will try to estimate the time needed to calculate the similarity between all the possible user pairs in the dataset.\n",
    "The order of a pair does not matter, \n",
    "<center>$(user_1, user_2) = (user_2, user_1)$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, the amount of pairs in the datasest is computable using the equation for combinations without permutations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> $C(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$</center>\n",
    "\n",

    "We estimate the total time by taking a specific amount of random pairs of users and measuring how long it takes to calculate all of the Jaccard similarities for these pairs. This time is then exterpolated to the total amount of time it will take for all pairs in the dataset by using the total amount of combinations. The equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TotalTime = \\frac{SubsetTime*TotalComb}{SubsetComb}$\n",
    "\n",
    "with TotalTime the total time it takes to calculate the Jaccard similarity for each pair in the dataset, SubsetTime the time it takes to calculate the Jaccard similarities for the subset of random pairs, TotalComb the total amount of combinations in the dataset and SubsetComb the total amount of combinations in the subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We take 100 random pairs for the first subset and calculate the TotalTime using the above equation. We then do this again for 500, 1000, 1200, 1500 and 2000 pairs. For each subset we calculate the TotalTime. The final estimation of the TotalTime is the mean of all of the TotalTime's of the subsets. "
